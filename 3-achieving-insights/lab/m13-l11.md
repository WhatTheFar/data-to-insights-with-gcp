# Data to Insights: [v1.0]: M13 L11: Optimizing and Troubleshooting Query Performance

## Fixing and Troubleshooting Query Performance

### Step 1

Open BigQuery: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com

### Step 2

Compose a New Query

### Step 3

Ensure `#standardSQL` is set

### Step 4

The below query is running slowly, what can you do to correct it? (run the query to get a benchmark)

```sql
#standardSQL
# count all paper filings for 2015
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2015`
WHERE UPPER(elf) LIKE '%P%' #Paper Filers in 2015
ORDER BY ein
# 86,831 as per pagination count, 23s
```

### Step 5

Compare against the below solution

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(\*) AS paper_filers FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2015`
WHERE elf = 'P' #Paper Filers in 2015

# 86,831 at 2s

/*
Remove ORDER BY when there is no limit
Use Aggregation Functions
Examine data and confirmed P always uppercase
*/
```

### Step 6

Run your updated version and track the time

### Step 7

Clear the Query Editor

### Step 8

This new below query is running slowly (run the query to get a benchmark - cancel after 30 seconds if it does not complete)

```sql
#standardSQL
  # get all Organization names who filed in 2015
SELECT
  tax.ein,
  name
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2015` tax
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_ein` org
ON
  tax.tax_pd = org.tax_period
```

### Step 9

Correct the above query (hint: remember the correct JOIN field condition for our schema)

### Step 10

Compare against the below solution

```sql
#standardSQL
  # get all Organization names who filed in 2015
SELECT
  tax.ein,
  name
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2015` tax
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_ein` org
ON
  tax.ein = org.ein

  # 86,831 as per pagination count, 23s

/*
   Incorrect JOIN key resulted in CROSS JOIN
   Correct result: 294,374 at 13s
*/
```

\*\* Step 11
Run your updated version and track the time. Do you see an improvement?

Watch out for unintentional CROSS JOINs by not having unique joining keys.

## Congratulations!

You have completed the Performance Optimization lab

Learning Review

- Only select the columns you need
- Filter as early as possible
- Ensure your join keys are unique
