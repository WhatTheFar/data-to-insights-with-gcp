# Data to Insights: [v1.0]: M11 L10: Practicing Querying Nested and Repeated Fields

## Working with Nested and Repeated Fields

You are given a reporting table that has nested and repeated rows. Each ein has it's name and corresponding expense and revenue accounts repeated. You will practice querying repeated rows through the use of `UNNEST( )`

### Step 1

Skim the below schema and note the repeated fields

### Step 2

Preview the Contents of the table by running the following query (or using the [Web UI to find and Preview](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/data-to-insights:irs_990.irs_990_repeated))

#standardSQL
SELECT \* FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated` LIMIT 10
The results should look similar to the below:

Note: Using BigQuery with Standard SQL will automatically flatten the array content into rows (as shown above) compared to Legacy SQL will return an error stating you need to explicitly flatten.

Step 3
Attempt to filter for all the Legal expenses by running the below query

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT * FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated`
WHERE expense_struct.type = 'Legal'
LIMIT 10
```

### Step 4

Confirm the error

Error: Cannot access field type on a value with type ARRAY<STRUCT<type STRING, amount INT64>>

We need to find another way to access those array elements.

### Step 5

Find the top 10 nonprofits that spent the most on legal expenses in the table. As a start, complete the below query by adding in the appropriate `UNNEST( )` and `WHERE` Clause filter on the expense type for â€˜Legal'. Hint: `UNNEST( )` typically follows the `FROM` much like a JOIN and should enclose a STRUCT.

```sql
#standardSQL
# Expenses by Category for each EIN
SELECT
  ein,
  expense
FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated` n
CROSS JOIN expense_struct AS expense
ORDER BY expense.amount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Step 6

Compare against the below solution

```sql
#standardSQL
# Expenses by Category for each EIN
SELECT
  ein,
  expense
FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated` n
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(n.expense_struct) AS expense
WHERE expense.type = 'Legal'
ORDER BY expense.amount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Step 7

Run the Query

### Step 8

Confirm the Result:

Note: The `CROSS JOIN` and `UNNEST( )` can be shorthanded as shown below. The `CROSS JOIN` becomes a comma and the `UNNEST( )` is optional as BigQuery assumes you want to unnest the n.expense_struct.

```sql
#standardSQL
# Expenses by Category for each EIN
SELECT
  ein,
  expense
FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated` n, n.expense_struct AS expense
WHERE expense.type = 'Legal'
ORDER BY expense.amount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Congratulations!

You have completed the Nested and Repeated Fields lab

Learning Review

- Arrays contain a set of values in a single field
- Use UNNEST() to work with data in arrays
- STRUCTs are containers for data
- BigQuery Repeated Fields are Arrays of Structs
- BigQuery tables with repeated fields are essentially pre-joined tables with significant performance benefits

## References

- Standard SQL and Legacy SQL handle repeated fields in very different ways. Refer to the [migration guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql) to see key differences in syntax.
