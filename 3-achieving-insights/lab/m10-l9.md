# Data to Insights: [v1.0]: M10 L9: Advanced Functions and Clauses

## Practicing with Sub-Queries

### Step 1

Open [BigQuery](http://bigquery.cloud.google.com/)

### Step 2

Compose Query

### Step 3

Using the provided query WITH clause below, write a SELECT statement that which calculates the `avg_income` (revenue - expenses) and sort the results by avg_income highest to lowest.

Also include `year_filed` and the other metrics from the WITH clause in your result.

```sql
#standardSQL
WITH summary AS (
# count of filings, revenue, expenses since 2013
SELECT
  CONCAT("20",_TABLE_SUFFIX) AS year_filed,
  COUNT(ein) AS nonprofit_count,
  AVG(totrevenue) AS avg_revenue,
  AVG(totfuncexpns) AS avg_expenses
FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_20*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '13'
GROUP BY year_filed
ORDER BY year_filed DESC
)

# write your code here
```

### Step 4

Compare your result against the solution below:

```sql
#standardSQL
WITH summary AS (
# count of filings, revenue, expenses since 2013
SELECT
  CONCAT("20",_TABLE_SUFFIX) AS year_filed,
  COUNT(ein) AS nonprofit_count,
  AVG(totrevenue) AS avg_revenue,
  AVG(totfuncexpns) AS avg_expenses
FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_20*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '13'
GROUP BY year_filed
ORDER BY year_filed DESC
)

SELECT
  year_filed,
  nonprofit_count,
  avg_revenue,
  avg_expenses,
  avg_revenue - avg_expenses AS avg_income
FROM summary
ORDER BY avg_income DESC
```

### Step 5

Run the Query

### Step 6

Which Year had the highest avg_income? What was it?

Solution: 2015 with 541214.61

Learning Review

- Use partitions and other analytic functions to perform calculations over a subset of your data
- Consider sub-queries to break up complex logic into multiple steps
